# Feed Reader Testing

 this project is the fourth project from Udacity Front-End Web developer Nanodegree and it is 
 a web-based application that reads RSS feeds and I tested the functionality of a Feed Reader using the Jasmine framework.
 I used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

## how to run the application

 1. Download the repository.
 2. Run index.html in your browser.
 3. check out all the feeds.

## Tests
1. RSS Feeds
 - the allFeeds is defined.
 - allFeeds is not empty.
 - allURLs is defined.
 - the URL is not empty and it is actually a URL.
 - allNames is defined.
 - the Name is not empty

2. The menu
 - is hidden by default.
 - should hiding/showing. 

3. Initial Entries
 - has at least a single entry.

4. New Feed Selection
 - the content changes when new feed is loaded.
